# SQL-DATABASE-ENGINEERING

The provided code includes the creation of several database tables, defining their structures (columns and data types), setting primary keys and constraints, creating foreign key relationships between tables, and inserting data into these tables. Here's a summary of what this code does.

Database Schema Creation:

It defines the schema for a relational database with several tables, including client_contacts, clients, employees, project_tasks, projects, and skills. Each table represents a different aspect of a business or project management system.

Constraints and Keys:

The code specifies primary keys for each table, ensuring that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable.
It establishes foreign key relationships between tables, linking data in one table to data in another. For example, client_contacts is linked to clients through the client_company_name foreign key, and employees is linked to client_contacts through the emp_client_contacts foreign key.

Data Insertion:

After defining the table structures and relationships, the code inserts sample data into the tables. This data represents fictional clients, client contacts, employees, projects, project tasks, and skills. SQL INSERT INTO statements are used to populate the tables with data.

System User Insertion:

The code includes SQL statements that select data from tables and append the SYSTEM_USER value. This can be useful for tracking who made changes to the database.
Comments and Documentation:

The code includes comments (lines starting with --) that provide information about the purpose of each section, such as table definitions, key constraints, and data insertion.

This code is meant to set up the structure of a database and populate it with sample data. It can serve as a foundation for a database system for managing clients, employees, projects, and tasks in a business or project management context. However, it's worth noting that the data provided is fictional and may be used for testing or demonstration purposes.
